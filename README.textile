h1. Git Commit Notifier

<pre>by Csoma Zoltan (info 'at' railsprogrammer 'dot' net)</pre>

Sends email commit messages splitting commits that were pushed in one
step. Email is delivered as text or HTML with changes refined per
word. Emails have a scanable subject containing the first sentence of
the commit as well as the author, project and branch name.

For example:
<pre>[rails][master] Fix Brasilia timezone. [#1180 state:resolved] </pre>

A reply-to header is added containing the author of the commit. This makes follow up really simple. If multiple commits are pushed at once, emails are numbered in chronological order:
<pre>
 [rails][master][000] Added deprecated warning messages to Float#months and Float#years deprications.
 [rails][master][001] Enhance testing for fractional days and weeks. Update changelog.
</pre>
